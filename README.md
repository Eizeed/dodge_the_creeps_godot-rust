### Why it even exists
<p>
I tried to use godot-rust as my side hassle, but got humbled very fast. 
I didn't understand some lines of code and how they translate/act with godot itself.
Now I rewrote godot's Dodge The Creeps! game in rust and commented a lot of thing,
but i did it only for things that i didn't understand, so probably you will find
some thing that you don't understand and there is no comment.
<p>
<p>
But i hope easy things for me are easy for you as well.
I tried my best to explain all difficult things in that project.
Also there is some addition like ESC bind to call game over.
Hope it will be useful :smile:
