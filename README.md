# Why it even exists
<p>
I tried to use godot-rust as my side hassle, but got humbled very fast.<br>
I didn't understand some lines of code and how they translate/act with godot itself.<br>
Now I rewrote godot's Dodge The Creeps! game in rust and commented a lot of things,
but i did it only for what i didn't understand, so probably you will find
some things that are not easy for you and there is no comment.
<p>
<p>
But i hope easy things for me are easy for you as well<br>
I tried my best to explain all difficult things in that project.<br>
Also there is some addition like ESC bind to call game over.<br>
Hope it will be useful :grin:
